ando-php
========

The initial few classes of this collection were produced while trying to independently solve [WordPress oldest ticket](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2691).
This collection started being PHP 5.2.4+ compatible because that is a WordPress requirement.

I'm going to add here some (rewritten) classes I developed along the years, so I'll probably boost the PHP version up...
